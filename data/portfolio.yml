    We launched <strong>Deploy Button</strong> for RailsRumble 2012. Our team Lizi won <strong>1st place</strong> as chosen by the public, and 3rd place as chosen by the judges. In the week since launch, Deploy Button received over <strong>15k uniques</strong>, and <strong>6k users</strong> have triggered a deploy.

    The idea was a simple button you could press whenever you wanted to deploy your site. Worked by pulling your code off github and pushing to any server.

    The key feature was that it could be called via webhook, so it enabled really simple continuous deployment (particularly using for a staging environment).

    Lizi was an intelligent agent for the web, that you can interact with in a chat like interface. We launched it early, and waited for people to tell us what they wanted it to do.

    Calendar / scheduling ended up working pretty well, but we couldn't get the product good enough to retain users. With Sunrise and other amazing calendaring apps launching at the same time, the "chat" angle wasn't enough to differentiate and we moved on.

    The (nutty) idea: <strong>Backup your hard drive via postal mail.</strong>

    Experiment we ran to see if this product was viable. We posted a landing page, bought some adwords, did some customer demos.

    Overseas we got quite a bit of interest. Of course being in US, this wasn't going to be viable. Very few techies locally had any interest in the service so we moved on.

  description: |
    AngelSquare was a way to virtually invest in companies on top of AngelList API.

    We built a chrome extension that allowed you to put fake money into companies you liked on AngelList and then use the market
    demand to assign prices to these shares. This allowed users to try to pick the "next hot company" early on, and see how well they did.

    The idea was the data generated from this "game" could actually be very useful in the real world to Angel Investors.

    It had some decent usage for about 3months, but as a sideproject, we couldn't really keep momentum going with it. The one thing that lasted from the project for a few years was an AngelList Profile widget that startups could embed on their site.

    Hello There was a tool that allowed you to create a video intro page to send to anyone. They could introduce themselves to investors, customers or a new career with a personalized web page and embedded video.

    The key feature was an instant alert when someone watched it so you could follow up with them immediately.

    We had some decent traction on it with AppSumo and StackSocial deals, and at one point it generated about $2k/mo, however we never really put the dev/marketing resources to allow it to grow.

    After running Hello There for a couple years, we shut it down.

    Built an infinite scrabble board game in 48 hours, called “Scrabb.ly” and won the popularity prize for the first NodeKnockout in 2010. Was quickly contacted by Hasbro lawyers, and we changed the name to WordSquared. At its peak, the board reached 42million tiles, before being shut down due to high hosting costs and a terrible environment for social gaming.
